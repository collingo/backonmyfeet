          My mum (Irena Bauer) got sick in 2004. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It was the worst message I could get. I will never forget the day when I came to her for a visit. My mum hugged me like she was about to leave for a long time.<br>
          I didn’t know it was the first GOOD BYE. But I knew when was the last one. Last year I had a dream. My mum was sitting next to me and she said: “I’m dying”. She passed away four days later.<br>
          I lost my best friend and now I want to get back on my feet. I want  to tell everyone about this terrible disease. Please buy my steps and help me to spread the word.

          When i grew up my mum was sick in breast cancer, but she was a fighter and she wouldn't let the cancer take anything away from raising me and my 2 brothers.<br>
          When i grew up i was always encouraged to go after my dreams and my parents supported me in all the different ways they could.<br>
          2 years ago it came back and this time it wouldn't go away, my mum still supported me to go after my dreams.<br>
          Last year i lost my beloved mum Eva Rydberg and now i need to get back on my feet to be able to continue to do what my mum encouraged me to do…<br>
          Please make me happy by donating money to cancer research by buying our steps towards brighton.<br><br>
